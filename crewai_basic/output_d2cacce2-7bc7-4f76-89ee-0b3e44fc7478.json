    "summary": "Purvesh Rathod is a technically proficient Backend Engineer candidate with 3+ years of experience, strong programming skills in Python, Java, and JavaScript, and solid cloud infrastructure knowledge (AWS certified). He demonstrates strong fundamentals in API design (REST/GraphQL), distributed systems concepts, and modern DevOps practices. His Master's degree from Dalhousie University and diverse project portfolio show promise. However, he presents as a MODERATE FIT for a senior backend engineering role due to gaps in critical areas: limited demonstrated experience designing large-scale production distributed systems (role requires 2+ years), no clear track record of mentoring junior engineers, and insufficient evidence of cross-functional collaboration. His experience appears more mid-level than senior, with projects leaning academic rather than production-scale. He would be an excellent candidate for a Backend Engineer II (mid-level) position or could be considered for the senior role if the hiring team has strong mentorship capacity to develop his leadership capabilities.",

His AWS certification, cloud infrastructure knowledge, and experience with REST/GraphQL APIs align well with the role. However, there are significant gaps in critical areas: he lacks demonstrated experience designing large-scale distributed systems (required 2+ years), no clear track record of mentoring junior engineers, and limited evidence of working in cross-functional team environments. His portfolio shows promising full-stack capabilities and entrepreneurial spirit, but projects appear more academic than production-scale. While his technical skills are solid, the role requires a more seasoned backend engineer with proven leadership, mentoring experience, and large-scale systems design background.
